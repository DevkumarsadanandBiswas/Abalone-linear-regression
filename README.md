# Abalone-linear-regression

The age of abalone is determined by cutting the shell through the cone, staining it, and counting the number of rings through a microscope â€” a boring and time-consuming task. We want to predict the age using different physical measurements which is easier to measure. The age of abalone is ( number of rings +1.5) years.
